- ability to change the selected window in a detached session
    (screen -S _daemons -X select 1; sds _daemons -- this only works if it is attached elsewhere)

- Change nomenclature of nav patch. "nav_mode" -> "window_order",
  "fixed"->"numeric", "floating"->"linked" ...?

- Add docs for nesting patch

- List of desired future patches

    - Simplify and remove cruft

    - Incorporate any good patches from mainline

    - Infrastructure changes, e.g. print a list of windows from
      command-line (like tmux)

- "term" command when TERM env var is set

- Get rid of "fuzzy" session name matching altogether? it prevents us
  from creating a session called "t" if e.g. "testing" already exists.

- Bug with multiple "-S" arguments?
