- Change nomenclature of nav patch. "nav_mode" -> "window_order",
  "fixed"->"numeric", "floating"->"linked" ...?

- Add docs for nesting patch

- List of desired future patches

    - Simplify and remove cruft

    - Incorporate any good patches from mainline

    - Infrastructure changes, e.g. print a list of windows from
      command-line (like tmux)

- "term" command when TERM env var is set

- Get rid of "fuzzy" session name matching altogether? it prevents us
  from creating a session called "t" if e.g. "testing" already exists.

- Bug with multiple "-S" arguments?

---------------- Finished:

\- Set "sticky" bit of socket files so that systemd doesn't delete them

\- Fix setscreen script and include it (it could be an option too)

\- Complain when "-X" message is too long for socket

\- Document how to regenerate patch series

\- Depend on timestamps of patches

\- Initial commit

\- Explain rationale for inclusion/exclusion

\- Fix install instructions

\- Script to install everything
