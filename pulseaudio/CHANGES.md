This is a working (for me) version of [Pulseaudio](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gchini/pulseaudio.git/) which doesn't glitch on volume changes. It is based on branch "gchini/pulseaudio-rewind_fixes" (see [BUILD](BUILD)).

*NB*: need to update against gchini's latest patches. Currently has problems with Zoom not finding microphone when local Pulseaudio is running.
