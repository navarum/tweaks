## Changes to bsdgames tetris

- Don't sleep when "eliding" full rows

- Don't ask if user wants to see scores

- Keep track of statistics like total time, number of rotations, etc. and print them at the end

  (The purpose of the last change is to make it easier to use this game for psychology experiments)

      Your score:  43 points  x  level 2  =  86
      # Final statistics #
      Time: 10.1
      Paused: 1.1
      Rotations: 8
      Right trans: 6
      Left trans: 4
      Drops: 3
      # End of statistics #
