- put $patchbase into .cloned, and bail if it changes

- is there a reason not to rewrite this in Zsh?

- support "uninstall"

- put something in build-common.sh to automate recreating patches
  directory

- need a better way to present the patches I made to each project, so
  they can be reviewed in the browser, like "patches directory ->
  html". something that works on github, and doesn't require
  javascript, and doesn't require committing generated files to the
  main branch...

- clean up stderr output of build

- include old, better version of Perl CGI
